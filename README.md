# Momentum-Space Worldline QMC

This repository hosts a staged implementation of the momentum-space worldline QMC Monte Carlo described in `note.md`. The simulation keeps the auxiliary field fixed and samples fermionic world lines and permutations to study the average sign.

Development proceeds according to `AGENTS.md`. Each stage introduces focused functionality, supporting tests, and documentation updates. See `docs/plan_stage0.md` for the current scaffold and planned components.
